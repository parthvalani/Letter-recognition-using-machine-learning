here, I attached all the jupyter notebook file with the outputs and enough comments. 
While, all python file only contains code and comment. 
You can see the results in 'results' folder. if you want to see the implementention in cmd.



Must Read:
The implementation results of python file may be slightly different then jupyter notebook file because It changes every time when we use neural network.
